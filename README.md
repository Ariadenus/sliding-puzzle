# Sliding Puzzle

[Sliding Puzzle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle) implemented in [**Scala**](http://www.scala-lang.org/).

## Multi-platform

Thanks to [Scala.js](http://www.scala-js.org/), it compiles both to:

1. Desktop JVM application
2. Browser JavaScript RIA

As much as possible, I've tried to have UI and platform-agnostic code. This lead to a better design which made the different implementations not only possible but straightforward.

### Desktop Version

The native JVM version uses [JavaFX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaFX) for its UI, and can be seen here:

### Browser Version

Here's a screenshot of the [Scala.js](http://www.scala-js.org/) based version, running on the browser:

## Building

### JavaFX Version

You'll need Oracle's JDK 7 or later (as of 2013, OpenJDK will not work as it does not include JavaFX).

Run using SBT with:

```
sbt javafx/run
```

### Scala.js Version

You need to properly "install" Scala.js as instructed on its website (build and publish locally).

#### Unoptimized / Development

Development, or "unoptimized", mode compiles code very quick. The caveat is that the generated code is very big and takes longer for the browser to load.

Package unoptimized code with SBT with:

```
sbt scalajs/packageJS
```

This will generate unoptimized JavaScript files. To load the unoptimized version of the puzzle, open `index-dev.html` in the browser (located inside the `scalajs` directory).

#### Optimized / Production

Optimized code takes considerably longer to compile, but the generated code is much smaller and loads very quickly in the browser.

Generate optimized code with SBT with:

```
sbt scalajs/optimizeJS
```

This will generate one optimized JavaScript file using [Google's closure compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/).

To load the optimized version of the puzzle, open `index.html` in the browser (located inside the `scalajs` directory).

## Notes

### About the picture

The musicians you see on the picture are part of a Jazz "[Big Band](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_band)".

I wanted to use this picture for this puzzle because it portraits two of my favourite jazz-instruments: 

* **baritone sax** (left)
* **trombone** (right)
